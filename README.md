 This project name is "Covid-19 effect prediction using Machine Learning". I use the new data for this prediction. The date of the new data is 9 April, 2021. I use upcoming dates for predicting total new cases of Bangladesh. I use "Jupyter Lab" to run this code. 
 
 I collect this data from WHO. Here is the data for all countries. Anyone can use this data and code for any countries prediction.
